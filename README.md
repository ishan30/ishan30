### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**ishan30/ishan30** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Full stack app with Angular + dot net core + Azure 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - Azure certification courses from Microsoft Learn
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Angular projects
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with improvising my code with industry standard coding practices & implementation
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Angular , Microsoft tech stack, Azure cloud & some Chelsea football club
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: twitter.com/ishan_cfc
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: E- sha - n
- âš¡ Fun fact: I believe in the near future knowing how to code will be as necessary as knowing how to write is today. Yes, regardless of the field or career your students decide for their future.
